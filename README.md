# EditorConfig for [Visual Studio Code][]

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode)

Forked from [`Microsoft/vscode-editorconfig`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-editorconfig), because issues and pull requests were not being addressed in a timely manner, probably because they are busy making [Visual Studio Code][] better! Microsoft put us off to a great start, but this fork allowed us to iterate much faster, which has proven to be quite successful.

Any effort to merge the projects [remains to be seen](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode/issues/11), but this fork is definitely more feature-rich and evolved than the upstream repository, which has become a bit stagnant. As such, you will get much better results using this extension over the Microsoft one.

Fee free to submit any issues you may have via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode/issues).
